### Introduction
AMCOT-APM-BB is an adaptive multi-cognitive objective temporal task learning approach designed for predicting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. Our method effectively integrates multi-task learning strategies with an advanced temporal modeling framework to improve the accuracy and stability of AD progression prediction. 

This research has been accepted for presentation at **BIBM 2024**.

### Features
- **Multi-Task Learning (MTL):** Our approach leverages multiple cognitive objectives to enhance predictive performance.
- **Temporal Task Modeling:** Incorporates sequential information to better capture disease progression trends.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism:** Dynamically adjusts task contributions to improve model generalization.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Outperforms existing methods in key AD progression prediction benchmarks.

### Repository
The official implementation of **AMCOT-APM-BB** is available at: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/XuanhanFan/MTL-AMCOT-BB)
